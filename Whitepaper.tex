\begin{abstract}\label{abstract}

We describe a secure and extensible operating system for smart contracts. Using
a capability-based exokernel protocol, we can facilitate secure isolation,
perform upgrades in a secure and robust manner, and prevent privilege escalation
at any point in the development process. The protocol is intended to serve as an open
standard and building block upon which more advanced and tailored security
models can be built.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}
\begin{quote}
``Every program and every privileged user of the system should operate
using the least amount of privilege necessary to complete the job.''

--- Jerome Saltzer, Communications of the ACM
\end{quote}

The underlying idea of decentralized organizations is the use of
blockchain technology to securely manage and track a broad range of
predominantly financial interactions without requiring a trusted third
party.

While this unlocks a huge potential, the development and deployment of such
organizations
has a high barrier of entry. Smart contract\footnote{
  A more appropriate, accurate name for smart contracts may be stored
  procedures (\href{https://twitter.com/VladZamfir/status/1051162300437020673}{as proposed by Vlad Zamfir} and used in database terminology).
  Smart contracts have also been critiqued by \citet{ASICSmithMJS}.
} development practices and
tooling are still in their prenatal stages of maturity, with zero margin
for error. Additionally, organizations must be extensible upfront to
allow changes and upgrades to their systems while still maintain high
standards of safety.

Beaker is a minimal open-source exokernel\footnote{An exokernel exposes as much
of the underlying hardware the system as possible, without larger abstractions
such as filesystems. In Beaker we expose all the underlying mechanisms (such as
storage) directly to the contract, with only the permissions layer in-between.}
protocol that serves as a building block for establishing secure and scalable
organizations. Beaker enables organizations that will grow in complexity and
will require long term extensibility.

Using Beaker, users can establish an organization on the blockchain with
a much higher level of confidence in its stability and security. The
safety model Beaker provides not only reduces risk, but allows
organizations to be designed in a much more flexible and robust manner.

The exokernel model of Beaker allows organizations to freely define
their own systems and procedures, but within a safe and controlled
environment. The Beaker kernel provides the building blocks and
primitives that organizations need to build more nuanced security and governance
models to suit their use case. Most critically, by using the primitives
Beaker provides, designers of these systems will then be able to
demonstrate these security guarantees to others without requiring manual-code verification.

\section{Problems}\label{problems}
Smart contracts are, by their nature, unforgiving machines that follow their
specification to the letter. This is one of the main benefits of smart
contracts, but it can also be their downfall, as the machine will faithfully
execute any flaw or mistake in that code. This is a well known property of smart
contracts, and is tackled in a variety of ways. One example is by employing
lower level primitives like multi-signature wallets or escrow accounts. Using
these tools we can encode a way in which participants in a transaction can
``back out'' of a transaction, or ensure that the correct approvals procedure is
in place. The developers of smart contracts can thereby build a more flexible
and forgiving system on top of the raw and unforgiving Ethereum machine
underneath.

Particularly for financial operations, building higher level systems with
these features is clearly necessary to be able to handle complex situations.
However, these higher level systems dramatically increase the complexity of the
system one is using. With this complexity comes another risk: one small mistake
or vulnerability in the code can bring down the whole system. This forces users
to strike a balance between flexibility of the system and complexity of the
code. Increasingly, this balance has fallen more on the side of complexity.

\subsection{Isolation}\label{isolation}
As smart contracts embrace this concept they are growing in size and
capabilities. Complexity is
progressively becoming a larger and larger issue. Already today we see many
smart
contracts being comprised of tens of different smart contracts operating
together. These ``smart contract systems'' are also being provided with
mechanisms to perform upgrades to their code, and the task of wrangling all of
these issues is
passed to the developer, with little support from their tools and underlying
systems, and little oversight from their stakeholders.

Take an example of a smart contract system that contains multiple components.
One component is tasked with maintaining the list of members of the group, and
another is
tasked with maintaining an allocation of tokens. As all of this code operates in
the same space, there is nothing actively preventing the code which is supposed
to be maintaining the list of members from modifying the allocation of tokens.
The only thing preventing this code from reallocating all of the tokens, is that
the developers and their auditors have correctly written and checked the code
such that it doesn't.

Developers and auditors are not weaponless in this fight, and rely on a variety
of tools including DSLs (Domain Specific Languages), static analysis, and formal
verification to write this code correctly and perform the right checks. These
are excellent tools to combat these problems, however, they have
two primary limitations:

\begin{itemize}
  \item This is a difficult and complicated process. Much like any other complex
  process, a single mistake can result in a major flaw. If this is the single
  line of defence (as is common currently in smart contracts) then this flaw
  will not be caught by any other system.
  On a regular computer or server, if the code tries to do
  something too far out of its bounds it will be caught by the operating system.
  In smart
  contracts all code can make any change to the system, so an uncaught mistake
  has limitless consequences.
  \item These tools are available only to highly trained developers and auditors
  with the resources (i.e. time) to apply those skills to the code. Other
  stakeholders in the system are able to gain little or no insight into the
  code. They simply have to trust the developer.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Upgrades}\label{upgrades}
One area where the lack of isolation in smart contracts is most problematic is
in the upgrading of smart contracts. DSLs, verification, auditing, etc., are
excellent tools to ensure that a smart contract will behave as intended, but
where they struggle to maintain their effectiveness is during upgrades. Once an
upgrade occurs, the whole system needs to be re-audited to ensure the same
constraints still apply.
With a multi-component smart contract, it is increasingly possible to update one
or more of these components as the need arises, including for important security
fixes.

Being able to change the code in a smart contract system is important, as it
gives us the ability to correct errors. However, it also gives us the ability
to introduce new ones or
allow malicious actors to introduce them. In the example above, what was
once a component to maintain a list of members can now become a component which
siphons all of the funds held by the contract to an account held by a
disgruntled developer.

In this example, the smart contract system suffered due to a lack of isolation.
Perhaps it was a vulnerability in the members list component that was exploited,
but the damage was far reaching and unrestricted. In traditional computing this
is a common issue that needs guarding against, and is known as \textbf{privilege
escalation}. This is also a concern in smart contracts without upgrades, but
with upgrades the path to privilege escalation becomes easier, and more
difficult to defend against.

\section{Existing Work}\label{existing-work}
The Ethereum smart contract blockchain is a concrete VM (virtual machine) which
is very well defined and standardized. However, Ethereum itself provides no
platform or protocols on which to base applications which have more complex
security requirements (which is nearly all smart contract applications). A
variety of platforms and protocols have been implemented and used which provide
frameworks for authentication, voting, security checks and various other
benefits. Many of these have been a success, but they are generally fairly
specialised and fragmented. Each of these frameworks is built to serve a
particular use case, and they are closely linked to the model
of the organization they were designed for. This means that the code for
providing security is closely intertwined with the application code.

The lack of a standard model for security mechanisms has so far contributed
to many
security vulnerabilities. One of the prominent examples was ``The DAO''
that was built to act as a hedge fund with a built-in proposal protocol
to manage funds. The implementation was written in a highly specialized
manner and did not separate the security mechanisms from the business
logic. This lead to a large attack surface and ultimately a re-entrancy
vulnerability that allowed the attacker to steal funds from the
organization itself.

\subsection{ZeppelinOS}
Of the recent projects that are making an impact in this area is the
ZeppelinOS\footnote{\url{https://zeppelinos.org/}} ZEP protocol by the Zeppelin Team.
Users of smart contract
libraries that use the ZEP protocol are able to vouch or vote for
upgrades they wish to adopt. Only code that is sufficiently vouched for
by the users is included in the system, with the developers working on
that code being rewarded in cryptocurrency assets. The vouching system
ensures that only code that has been approved by all the relevant users
is included and allocates monetary rewards to incentivize high quality
development work.

Unfortunately, this solution only solves a governance problem, which
does not address the issue of limited introspection and transparency of
the contracts themselves. In order to participate in this governance
model, one would need to be able to understand and guarantee that every
byte of code that one approves is correct. While the governance model
gives one power over what code is included and what isn't, it doesn't
equip one with the necessary tools or resources to make good decisions
long-term.

Only highly skilled developers who are familiar with both blockchain
contracts and the system involved have any hope of being able to
understand the detail of code changes, and even they are limited in the
resources they are able to spend on this activity. Regardless of what
promises you are being told, unless you are a developer - the system is
a black box. It requires sophisticated tools to be inspected and
understood; without sufficient resources you cannot verify on your own
how the system is actually implemented. Relying on developers alone - to
verify these systems as we do today - will not be enough to legitimize
smart contracts as secure financial instruments that the mainstream
market can trust long-term.

\subsection{AragonOS}
AragonOS\footnote{\url{https://aragon.org/}} is another example of smart contract
framework that seeks to take a more operating system style approach. Much like
Beaker, AragonOS features a permission system and a kernel, however, after that
the design diverges significantly. AragonOS aims to be a featureful platform on
which to build smart contract applications. While the permission system of
Beaker is targeted at isolating and limiting \emph{code}, the permission system
of AragonOS is targeted at a higher level, and is only one component of a vast
suite of features of the AragonOS platform. We take a different approach in that
the layer which isolates the various code components should be as separate and
minimal as possible, and independent of the features built on top of it.

\subsection{Domain Specific Languages}
There is another branch of activity which has been able to make good progress in
improving the state of the art, and that is by improving the languages and build
tools of developers. This includes DSLs, static
analysis tools, and even some that follow a similar ideal to Beaker and
incorporate a capability object model directly into the language. These tools
are a great boon for developers and can dramatically reduce programmer errors.
However, there is one very large drawback to these systems, which is that they
are for the benefit of the developer. Once the code is built and running
on-chain these tools have completed their task and are no longer in use. The
responsibility is placed squarely on the developers to ensure that these tools
are used correctly, and that the code that is running on chain accurately
reflects the steps they took.

However, this still relies on completely trusting developers and that the
constraints the developers believed they implemented were faithfully executed by
an off-chain compiler. None of this information is included or verified
\emph{on-chain}.

To solve this, we propose a more general approach by creating an
explicit security model for developing smart contracts that allows
developers the ability to establish semantic restrictions that can
communicate their intentions to their users. As an abstraction,
restrictions that can be easily understood establish transparency and
allow users an ability to verify these contracts on their own without
relying on 3rd party trust.

\section{Overview}\label{overview}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \includegraphics[width=0.49\textwidth]{media/NormalKernelOverview}
    \includegraphics[width=0.49\textwidth]{media/BeakerKernelOverview}

    \caption{Similar to how existing operating systems act as an
    interface to hardware for applications on a computer, the Beaker kernel
    provides an interface for smart contracts to securely access privileged
    assets and data of an organization.\label{fig:kernels}}
\end{figure}

In their early days, computers executed a sequence of instructions and
manipulated input and output devices, blindly following the instructions
laid out by the programmer. It was up to the programmer to ensure that
the program they wrote was correct. Once the computer was executing the
programmer had relinquished control and the program would execute as
written.

Driven by a need to manage multiple programs, and eventually include
restrictions, quotas, and permissions, operating systems were created.
With operating systems, the programs weren't just executed blindly by
the machine. When the machine encountered an instruction that required
hardware access, it suspended the running program and passed that
instruction to the operating system, which then decided what to do. This
gave the operator of the machine control over what was and wasn't
allowed to occur on the machine, at the cost of some run-time
monitoring.

On Ethereum the situation is very similar to those early days of
computers. Smart contracts are thoroughly audited and tested, but once
they are on the blockchain they execute on the raw machine. If we want a
system where we can interpose ourselves between our components and
potentially dangerous resources (such as our storage) we need to make
strong guarantees that components of our system will only abide by the policies
we set, and won't break the rules.

In order to do so, we need to require that all contracts interact with critical
resources only through system calls to our `kernel' that we have placed in
between the code and the dangerous resources. Once a contract is only operating
through system calls, the operating system kernel has the final say on what the
contract can or cannot do.

\end{document}\subsection{Procedures}\label{procedures}
A Procedure is a smart contract that can be executed by the kernel. This is the
smallest independent component or unit of code. As far as the Ethereum VM is
concerned they are a normal smart contract.
Unlike normal smart contracts, procedures have several restrictions.
Critically, procedures are only able to access state changes (i.e. the dangerous
things) via system
calls, and are not able to directly access storage, make outside calls
or send transactions.

Much like processes are stored in a process table within a traditional
operating system, procedures are stored within a Procedure Table held by the
kernel. Each
entry contains the id, capability list, and address of the procedure.
Unlike a process table however, the procedure table does not maintain
procedure state across separate transaction calls.

\subsection{On-Chain Code
Verification}\label{on-chain-code-verification}
In order to verify that a procedure follows certain restrictions we use
On-Chain Code Verification. On-chain code verification is the use of a
trusted smart contract to read and verify the code of an untrusted smart
contract. By reading the code of an untrusted contract (via the EXTCODECOPY
opcode), we can analyse it and make assertions about what it can and cannot do.

With on-chain code verification we can check if an untrusted contract has any
opcodes that we
don't allow. In particular this allows us to check if a
contract can potentially: self destruct, make state changes, emit events,
or make an external call. This might not seem like a big restriction, but the
absence of
such code allows us to make certain guarantees. For example: if the code
does not contain the combination of SELFDESTRUCT, DELEGATECALL or
CALLCODE, we now know that this code will never be able to be destroyed.

In our case, the trusted contract (which performs the verification) will be our
kernel, while the
untrusted contract would be a procedure. Before running a procedure, the
kernel can check and verify the procedure, allowing the kernel to
enforce certain restrictions or access control. The kernel only needs to
do this check only once however, since in Ethereum the code of a
contract can never change.

\subsection{System Calls}\label{system-calls}
As we covered above, a traditional operating system achieves
introspection and control by interposing itself between the processes
that are running and all other parts of the system including storage,
memory, and even other processes. Each process is given its own memory
and access to a processor, but is otherwise completely isolated. In
order to do even the most fundamental task (be it print a character to
the screen or read some stored data) it must ask the operating system to
do so on its behalf. It is only through the operating system that the
process can affect the real world. Via this mechanism, the kernel has
complete control over what that process can and cannot do. These
requests to the operating system that a process makes are called System
Calls.

Beaker also uses this system call mechanism, and the sequence of EVM opcodes
that define a Beaker system call are outlined below. The
parameters of the system call are set prior to these 3 instructions, and are the
responsibility of the designer of the contract (presumably with significant
assistance from libraries).

\definecolor{mygreen}{rgb}{0,0.6,0}
\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=c,commentstyle=\color{mygreen},basicstyle=\ttfamily,
  identifierstyle=\color{blue},
  caption=Sequence of steps to perform a system call.]
CALLER         // Get Caller
GAS            // Put all the available gas on the stack
DELEGATECALL   // Delegate Call to Caller
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}

These instructions ensure that the contract is only calling to the
original kernel instance and nothing more. Because this sequence of
instructions is the only sequence of instructions with a state changing
opcode (DELEGATECALL) we can use on-chain code verification to prove
that a contract contains no state changing opcodes other than in the
form of a secure system call.

The delegate call is a call back into the kernel. The kernel will only
accept system calls from the procedure it is currently executing, ensuring the
kernel has a complete understanding and control over what is being executed.
The very first call the kernel makes (which is usually to the library code) is
done
via CALLCODE. This means that that our system, which we will call our
``kernel instance'', is the current storage and event space of the
running code. It also means that the CALLER value,
which is a global
read-only value, is set to the address of our kernel instance.
\footnote{One downside of this design
is that the original sender of the transaction must be included in the payload
of the transaction if it is needed. As the kernel address is more security
critical, and is needed more often, it is placed in the CALLER value.} When our
procedure does a DELEGATECALL, this address is maintained. As a
consequence, whenever a kernel is executing a system call, it is able to
simply check that the CALLER value is equal to its own address (it is
necessary for this value to be hardcoded into the instance, which is
performed during instantiation).

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{media/SystemCalls.pdf}
\caption{This diagram illustrates the general sequence of steps
done when a procedure executes a system call}
\end{figure}

The process for executing a procedure is as follows:

\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Kernel instance does a CALLCODE\footnotemark (i.e.~a regular
  library call) to the kernel
  library, executing the function in the kernel library that executes
  procedure.
\item
  The kernel library code uses the procedure table of the kernel
  instance to call the correct procedure using DELEGATECALL. During its
  execution, the procedure encounters a system call and performs a
  DELEGATECALL to the CALLER value, which is the kernel instance.
\item
  The kernel instance checks that itself is the original caller and if
  so, calls the kernel library for processing the system call.
\item
  After the system call is completed, the kernel library returns to the
  kernel instance, which then returns to the procedure.
\end{enumerate}
\end{minipage}
\footnotetext{The difference between CALLCODE and
  DELEGATECALL is that CALLCODE resets the CALLER value to whichever contract
  executed it. We use this to our advantage, as this sets the CALLER value to
  the kernel instance, allowing us to use it in system calls.}

\subsection{Procedure Registration}\label{procedure-creation}
Creating and adding a procedure to the kernel's procedure table (so that it can
be executed) involves two steps. The first is to create and deploy the procedure
as you would any other smart contract. Once it is deployed, it can then be
registered with the kernel by simply giving the kernel the address of the code
and letting the kernel handle the registration process. During this process, the
kernel will first run the code through the verification process to ensure that
the only state changing code it contains is run through the kernel. If the code
passes this verification process, it is then added to the kernel's procedure
table.

An important feature of this verification process is that it runs on-chain.
Although more expensive then verifying things off-chain, this verification
process is the core mechanism by which the kernel prevents execution of
untrusted opcodes. This verification means that the 'proof' now lies on-chain,
and we aren't simply trusting developers to have done the correct verifications.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{media/ProcedureCreation.pdf}
\caption{This diagram illustrates the general sequence of steps to
verify and add protection to the procedure template for it to be
included in the procedure table.}
\end{figure}


\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  First, the contract is built and deployed as usual.
\item
  Second, the address of the contract is passed to the kernel for registration.
  The kernel parses the code of this contract and verifies it does not contain
  any illegal opcodes. If any illegal opcodes are found, the contract is
  rejected.
\item
  To designate a syscall dispatch, the code must include a valid syscall
  entry. To allow the kernel ownership, it checks if the contract has an
  additional header that prevents unauthorized calls to the contract.
\item
  Once the code as been verified it is added to the kernel's procedure table,
  and can then be assigned capabilities.
\item
  The procedure can then be used.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Entry Procedure}\label{entry-procedure}
We have now outlined a kernel that is generally only accessible from its
own procedures. It must, however, also accept some form of external
transaction, which is the only way it can be triggered to execute code.
As an operating system Beaker should have no say over what kind of
transactions and programs a system wants to execute, and should not impose any
format on those transactions. Beaker follows an
exokernel design, where the kernel itself should stay out of the user's
code as much as possible.

We can divide the calls that a Beaker kernel has to accept into two categories:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  A System Call, which will come from an executing procedure that the
  kernel itself called earlier.
\item
  An External Call from a 3rd party Ethereum address. This is what will
  trigger whatever actions the designer of the system has chosen to
  implement.
\end{enumerate}

We have covered above how system calls are secured by ensuring that the kernel
only accepts system calls from procedures it is currently calling. To allow the
system to interact with users, we must also establish a way to handle external
transactions.

In order to define an external interface to the kernel, we designate a
procedure of our choice as the Entry Procedure. This entry
procedure is created (and updated if need be) by the user, and is
executed as a normal procedure. When the kernel instance receives an
external transaction from another Ethereum address, it simply forwards
the message data to the entry procedure. Thus whenever any transaction
reaches the kernel, it is up to our entry procedure to decide what
should happen and act as the interface to the kernel. This would look something
like this:

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{media/EntryProcedure.pdf}
\caption{This diagram presents the general sequence of steps used
for executing an entry procedure.}
\end{figure}


\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  A user creates an order to execute a procedure. The format is defined
  by the entry procedure, but would usually contain the procedure id,
  and whatever payload the procedure needs.
\item
  The Kernel looks up the entry procedure in the procedure table, and
  dispatches it.
\item
  The entry procedure reads the payload and performs whatever user
  authentication logic the developer of the system desires.
\item
  If the payload is valid, the entry procedure looks up procedure X and
  calls it, procedure X does its primary function, which in this example
  is to store the string ``Hello World'' in storage. This is done using
  a syscall invoked using the necessary capability.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Auditability and the Principle of Least
Privilege}\label{auditability-and-the-principle-of-least-privilege}
Existing systems such as DSLs or libraries
offer some level of verification and guarantees. Before the smart
contracts are deployed, the developer is able to use these tools to
verify the contracts. However, once these contracts are deployed they
contain no information that can be used to readily verify the system.
They have become opaque, and the verification information is only
available to the developer.

By using an operating system model, Beaker is able to enforce isolation
at runtime. The information on the isolation of the system is contained
within the kernel and can be audited quite simply by anyone looking at
the system. This allows us to not only isolate the highest risk portion
of our code and reduce our attack surface, but also to verifiably
demonstrate that to others. To an outside auditor, many chunks of a
Beaker system will also be opaque black boxes. The difference is, this
auditor will be able to see which permissions are applied to which black
box. In other words the system becomes a collection of isolated and
restricted black boxes.

Just as when running Linux or any other regular system, it is of course
possible to run all code with full permissions (i.e.~root). All of the
system code can be included in a single procedure with full capabilities
and the system will become as secure as a regular smart contract. But by
applying isolation, Beaker allows developers to separate their system
into specialised components. These components that can then implement
large amounts of logic without the risk of accidentally (or maliciously)
executing some of the more dangerous functions of the system.

In order to do this, we need a security model to apply to procedures and
system calls.

\section{Security Model}\label{security-model}
We established two critical components of the Beaker exokernel:
introspection via system calls, and isolation via procedures to achieve
the principle of least privilege.

System calls establish a way in which the operating system can now allow
or deny various system calls. For this to be used effectively there
needs to be a system for specifying policies. It is these policies that
determine when the kernel should allow or deny a particular action.

In regular computing these restrictions do not generally exist within
programs. It is not possible in most programming languages to import a
library or module and say ``my program sends packets over the network,
and must have permission to do so, but this section of code coming from
this library should not be able to''. This is the state of Ethereum
security currently. Everything is built as a single program, without
internal security boundaries available (the new STATICCALL opcode is an
attempt to implement this).

However, now that we have established an operating system with system
calls, we now have that point of control over the contracts running on
our system, and we can craft policies to allow or deny any action that
interacts with the rest of the system.

To implement these policies, Beaker uses a capability-based
access-control model. Access control governs all procedures; in order to
perform a system call a procedure must possess an unforgeable token or
key called a Capability. This capability identifies the particular
resource a procedure wants to access, and simply by being in the
procedures possession gives the procedure authority to use that
resource.

\subsection{Criteria for a Policy
Mechanism}\label{criteria-for-a-policy-mechanism}
The tradeoffs in designing a policy mechanism are many. If the policy
mechanism is too simple, it will not be able to provide the necessary
security guarantees. If it is too complex, then the system becomes far
less auditable and almost as complex as the procedures themselves.

Therefore, a policy mechanism must have two critical criteria:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  It must be simple to read and analyze separately from the code it
  applies to.
\item
  It must be able to represent the guarantees about a system (i.e.~the
  restrictions) that users wish to make.
\end{enumerate}

These two factors are informed by the design already:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Given the high stakes and low quantity of code in smart contracts,
  this allows more complex policy mechanisms to be practical, as any
  system deployed as smart contracts must already be heavily audited.
\item
  Beaker follows a microkernel approach so as to give as much freedom to
  the designer as possible. For this reason it is necessary to make as
  few assumptions about the use case of users as possible.
\end{enumerate}

Amongst complex smart contract systems the exact requirements differ
significantly, but the base requirements stay the same. The key goal is
to improve the security and auditability of the system such that an
external party or higher level ``system designer'' can be given control
over what the various contracts in the system can do. This would allow
them to compartmentalise areas of code and ensure that it only has the
privileges it requires, allowing them to focus attention on more
critical high-risk code. Even if another member of the organization
updates a contract under his or her control, the system designer should
be able to limit the potential damage of an error or malign action by
sandboxing that contract.

The goal of the security model then becomes to design a system that can
make these guarantees, and present it to those designing or auditing the
system in such a way that they can be checked using fewer resources and
less knowledge.

As an example: in the Linux kernel, the permission bit mask and owner on
a user's personal file allows them to quickly and easily see (by listing
the properties of their files with \texttt{ls\ -l}) that only they, and
anybody with root access can access their files. The simple string
presented by \texttt{ls\ -l} of
\texttt{-rw-r-\/-\/-\/-\/-\ bob\ users\ file.txt} instantly tells
\texttt{bob} that (with the exception of root) only he can modify
\texttt{file.txt}, while other users in the group users can also read
it, but nobody else has access. This short simple string forms the
policy placed on that file. It's simplicity means that the restrictions
placed on that file are easily verifiable. It is not necessary to verify
all the code on the system, because we know that the Linux kernel will
enforce this policy.

\subsection{Implementing a Capability Based Security
Model}\label{implementing-a-capability-based-security-model}
All policies in Beaker are applied directly to procedures. Beaker is a
capability-based OS and therefore the policies take the form of a
Capability List. Each capability in this list is an unforgeable key.
This key is both an identifier for a resource, and an inherent
permission to access that resource. The procedure cannot act outside
this set of capabilities. Even if the procedure is updated, the limits
of the procedure do not expand unless the capabilities associated with
that procedure also expand.

By applying these capabilities at a procedure level, the policy
mechanism becomes very simple. Where more complex policies are required,
they can often be modelled by using simple procedures that ``become''
the policies and can be more simply audited.

It is critical to note that the capability system proposed here does not
attempt to deal at all with ``users''. If a particular system includes
users (which is to be expected) it is left to the creators of that
system to dictate how that is organised and implemented.

For this reason, Beaker aims to help system designers implement their
own higher level permissions systems on solid primitives, rather than to
anticipate all the use cases for those using Beaker.

Presented here is an outline of what a simplistic capability system
might look like in Beaker. A procedure is created in two steps:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Creation/Update: where the contract bytecode is uploaded to the
  kernel.
\item
  Permission assignation: where somebody with the appropriate capability
  sets the capabilities of the new procedure.
\end{itemize}

When a procedure is created, it has zero capabilities available to it in
its list. If, for example, it needs to modify the storage value at 0x7,
it will need to be provided with that permission by a separate
permission assignation. In this workflow, the procedure is deployed by a
developer, and the permissions are assigned by the system designer once
he approves this. The workflow around how permissions are requested and
designed are left to the users.

The advantage of this design, where capabilities are assigned to
procedures, is that it is simple and enforceable. Compared to some other
capability system designs this does have a few limitations. One
limitation is that it does not support dynamically chosen capabilities. For
example this means that it is not possible to pass a capability of a
particular storage location to a procedure. This is an often touted
feature of capability systems that allows for the delegation of
authority. The advantage of eschewing such a feature is that it makes
the capabilities more static and auditable.

\subsection{Custom User Permissions}\label{custom-user-permissions}
A capability-based security model allows the flexibility to define a
procedure that can act as a custom permission system akin to an access
control list. With a custom permission system, users are free to define
their own hierarchies or groups in order to satisfy their particular
requirements. Thus users are not forced to follow a specific permission
model that does not fit their needs and still maintain safety through
establishing explicit access control within the system.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{media/Separation.pdf}
\caption{By separating admin management from user management, the
principle of least authority can be applied.}
\end{figure}

An example access model can involve group decision making by vote, where
a procedure is created to check votes and dispatch actions on resources
within its allowed capabilities. Such a procedure can act as an
administration system to maintain and upgrade previously defined
components within the organization by secure vote.

Another example can involve groups, where a group is assigned control over
a procedure with designated capabilities that define how the group can
affect the organization. This in effect can be used as an explicit
safeguard where each group cannot compromise the other's resources.

\subsection{Kernel Objects}\label{kernel-objects}

\end{table}

Each Kernel Object is a category of related capability types. Kernel
objects designate the resources in the kernel that are protected by the
kernel reference monitor and can only be indirectly accessed by invoking
a system call.

\subsubsection{Procedure Table}\label{procedure-table}
Sometimes, procedures need to access information about themselves as
well as the state of the kernel. This includes the capabilities it has
available as well as finding what other procedures are available. It is
also important for procedures to able to dispatch other procedures if
they are allowed to do so. This is usually when a procedure is used as a
policy to check and verify if the appropriate signatures have been done.
The procedure table object is a dynamic list of procedure identifiers
that designate what procedures the kernel has available. Each procedure
is defined by a unique identifier, contract address and a capability
list.

\subsubsection{Storage}\label{storage}
Storage is the only way procedures can store and modify data. However,
allowing procedures to directly access storage is unsafe and would
inadvertently allow procedures to access or modify data that they do not
own. To prevent this, storage is abstracted into capabilities that
provide a separate key ranges for each procedure that they are allowed
to modify. Additionally, procedures can provide access to other
procedures to share or modify tables that they own.

The Storage object is defined by a 32 byte storage location where a
procedure can either read or write a 32 byte value. In order to provide
the kernel a protected storage space, storage is divided into two
spaces, with half of locations assigned to kernel-space and and the
other half assigned to user-space storage. This provides all procedures a
user-space of $2^{255}$ unique keys. The number of storage keys far outweighs
the capacity of the storage system itself, so will not be a limiting
factor long term.

\subsubsection{Events}\label{events}
Events are crucial for signalling verified changes to the outside world,
accessing data asynchronously, as well as their use in establishing
off-chain networks. In Ethereum, logs can be ascribed from 0–4 topics,
with each topic being a 32-byte value. These topics are handled as
addresses or namespaces. In order to log to a specific topic, the
procedure must have the capability to do so. This capability is the
write capability included under the Log object in the table kernel
object table above. This capability type is then refined to dictate
which topics it can write to.

\subsubsection{Gas}\label{gas}
The Gas object is defined as the total gas resources the kernel has
available and designates how much resources are allocated to a procedure
to spend during execution as well as how much gas it is allowed to send
to an external address.

\section{Summary}\label{summary}
The Beaker exokernel protocol provides a secure environment for
organizations to establish extendible business logic through restricted
smart contracts defined as procedures.

By using a low level capability-based security model, Beaker allows
developers to design custom permissions and policies that suit their use
case, rather than lock organizations into a particular governance model.
These will also form a standard set of primitives that can be used to
reduce the burden of verification and communicate the security design of
the system to others in a transparent manner.
